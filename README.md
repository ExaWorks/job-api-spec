# job-api-spec

The purpose of this repository is to foster discussion and analysis of the
design and implementation issues of a job management API suitable for use on
exascale machines, as well as to propose such an API.  The  current state of the
discussion and the draft API specification are captured in
[specification.md](specification.md).  We invite readers to submit issues to:

  - Provide additional use cases you would like to see considered.
  - Discuss assumptions and scope of the API specification.
  - Point out errors or inconsistencies.
  - Suggest changes or additions to the specification.
